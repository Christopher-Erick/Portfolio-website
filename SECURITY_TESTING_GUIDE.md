---

## Quick Start Testing

### 1. **Automated Security Audit**
```bash
# Run complete security audit
python security_manager.py all

# Individual checks
python security_manager.py check     # Configuration check
python security_manager.py activity  # Suspicious activity check
python security_manager.py report    # Generate security report
```

### 2. **Automated Security Tests**
```bash
# Run comprehensive security tests
python security_test.py
```

### 3. **Interactive Browser Testing**
```bash
# Open the security testing dashboard
start security_test_dashboard.html
# (or open it manually in your browser)
```

## Detailed Testing Procedures

### üß™ **Contact Form Security Tests**

#### Test 1: XSS Protection
```javascript
// Try this in the contact form
Name: <script>alert('XSS')</script>
Email: test@evil.com
Subject: <img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
Message: javascript:alert('XSS')

// Expected Result: Form should reject input and show validation error
```

#### Test 2: SQL Injection Protection
```javascript
// Try these in contact form fields
Name: '; DROP TABLE users; --
Email: admin@test.com' OR '1'='1
Subject: 1' UNION SELECT * FROM admin --

// Expected Result: Django ORM protects against SQL injection
```

#### Test 3: Input Validation
```javascript
// Test empty fields
Name: (empty)
Email: (empty)
Subject: (empty) 
Message: (empty)

// Expected Result: "All fields are required" error
```

### üö¶ **Rate Limiting Tests**

#### Test 1: Contact Form Rate Limiting
```bash
# Send multiple requests quickly (manual test in browser)
# Submit contact form 6 times rapidly

# Expected Result: After 3-5 submissions, should get rate limit error
```

#### Test 2: Admin Access Rate Limiting
```bash
# Try accessing admin multiple times
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ 

# Expected Result: Should be rate limited after multiple attempts
```

### üîí **Security Headers Tests**

#### Test 1: Check Headers in Browser
```
1. Open website in browser
2. Press F12 ‚Üí Network tab
3. Refresh page
4. Click on main request
5. Check Response Headers

Expected Headers:
‚úÖ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
‚úÖ X-Frame-Options: DENY
‚úÖ X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
‚úÖ Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

#### Test 2: CSP Testing
```html
<!-- Try adding this to test CSP -->
<script>alert('CSP Test')</script>

<!-- Expected Result: Should be blocked by Content Security Policy -->
```

### üë§ **Admin Security Tests**

#### Test 1: Default Admin URL
```bash
# Test if default admin URL is accessible
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

# Expected Result: Should redirect or be blocked
```

#### Test 2: Admin Login Attempts
```
1. Go to admin login page
2. Try wrong credentials multiple times
3. Check if account gets locked or rate limited

Expected Result: Should prevent brute force attempts
```

### üìÅ **File Upload Security Tests**

#### Test 1: Malicious File Upload (Admin Panel)
```
1. Login to admin panel
2. Try uploading files with these extensions:
   - .php
   - .jsp
   - .asp
   - .exe

Expected Result: Should reject dangerous file types
```

#### Test 2: File Size Limits
```
1. Try uploading very large files (>5MB)
2. Check if upload is rejected

Expected Result: Should enforce file size limits
```

### üïí **Session Security Tests**

#### Test 1: Session Timeout
```
1. Login to admin panel
2. Wait 1 hour without activity
3. Try accessing admin again

Expected Result: Should require re-login (session expired)
```

#### Test 2: Cookie Security
```
1. Open browser dev tools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage ‚Üí Cookies
3. Check cookie flags

Expected Flags:
‚úÖ HttpOnly: true
‚úÖ Secure: true (in production with HTTPS)
‚úÖ SameSite: Strict
```

## üîç **Browser-Based Security Tests**

### Chrome DevTools Security Check
```
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Security tab
3. Check security state

Expected Result: Should show secure connection and no mixed content
```

### Firefox Security Check
```
1. Press F12 ‚Üí Security tab
2. Check for security warnings

Expected Result: No security issues reported
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Advanced Security Testing Tools**

### Online Security Scanners
```
1. Mozilla Observatory: https://observatory.mozilla.org/
2. Security Headers: https://securityheaders.com/
3. SSL Labs: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/

Test when deployed to production
```

### Manual Penetration Testing
```bash
# Test with common security tools (ethical testing only)
nmap -sV your-domain.com
dirb http://your-domain.com
nikto -h your-domain.com

# Only use on your own domain with permission
```
