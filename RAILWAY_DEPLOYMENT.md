## Deployment Steps

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway:

     ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-app-name.up.railway.app,railway.app
     ```

3. Configure the start command:
   - Railway should automatically detect the start command from your Dockerfile or railway.toml

     ```
     gunicorn portfolio_site.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
     ```

4. Deploy the application:
   - Railway will automatically deploy when you push to your connected GitHub repository
   - Or trigger a manual deploy from the Railway dashboard

5. Run initial migrations:
   - Go to the "Deployments" tab in Railway
   - Click on the latest deployment

   - Run:
     ```
