# Project Media Fix Complete

## Summary

Your project media files (images and writeup documents) have been successfully fixed and are now properly configured to work with Cloudinary.

## What Was Done

1. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Fixed [.env](file://c:\Users\CHRISTOPHER\Desktop\project\RESUME\.env) file with correct Cloudinary credentials
   - Updated [.gitignore](file://c:\Users\CHRISTOPHER\Desktop\project\RESUME\.gitignore) to exclude sensitive files
   - Ensured proper Django settings for Cloudinary integration

2. **File Upload to Cloudinary**:
   - Uploaded all project images to `writeupsimages/` folder in Cloudinary
   - Uploaded all writeup documents as raw files to `writeups_raw/` folder in Cloudinary
   - Verified successful upload of all files

3. **Database URL Updates**:
   - Updated all project featured images to use versioned Cloudinary URLs
   - Updated all project writeup documents to use raw file Cloudinary URLs
   - Verified that all URLs are correctly configured in the database

## Current Status

All 3 projects now have properly configured media files:

### Vulnerability Assessment Project
- **Featured Image**: [VULNERABILITY_ASSEMEMENT.PNG](file://c:\Users\CHRISTOPHER\Desktop\project\RESUME\media\projects\VULNERABILITY_ASSEMEMENT.PNG) → Cloudinary URL
- **Writeup Document**: [SECURITY_ASSESSEMENT.pdf](file://c:\Users\CHRISTOPHER\Desktop\project\RESUME\media\projects\writeups\SECURITY_ASSESSEMENT.pdf) → Cloudinary raw URL

### SIEM Log Analysis Project
- **Featured Image**: [splunk.png](file://c:\Users\CHRISTOPHER\Desktop\project\RESUME\media\blog\splunk.png) → Cloudinary URL
- **Writeup Document**: [Splunk_Exploring_SPL.pdf](file://c:\Users\CHRISTOPHER\Desktop\project\RESUME\media\projects\writeups\Splunk_Exploring_SPL.pdf) → Cloudinary raw URL

### Malware Analysis Project
- **Featured Image**: [malware.PNG](file://c:\Users\CHRISTOPHER\Desktop\project\RESUME\media\projects\malware.PNG) → Cloudinary URL
- **Writeup Document**: [Malware_Analysis.pdf](file://c:\Users\CHRISTOPHER\Desktop\project\RESUME\media\projects\writeups\Malware_Analysis.pdf) → Cloudinary raw URL

## Verification

- All image URLs are accessible and return HTTP 200 status
- All document URLs are configured to use Cloudinary's raw file delivery
- Database entries have been updated with correct Cloudinary URLs

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**: Push your changes to your hosting platform
2. **Set Environment Variables**: Ensure your production environment has the correct Cloudinary credentials
3. **Test in Browser**: Visit your portfolio site to confirm all media displays correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Images Not Loading**: Check that the image URLs in the database match the actual Cloudinary URLs
2. **Documents Not Accessible**: Documents may require authentication depending on your Cloudinary plan
3. **URL Mismatches**: Run the verification scripts to check URL accessibility

Your portfolio projects should now display all images and writeups correctly!
