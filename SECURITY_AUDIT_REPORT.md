# Security Audit Report

This report documents the security improvements made to the cybersecurity portfolio website to ensure it is safe for production deployment while preserving all personal information.

## Executive Summary

All hardcoded personal information has been secured by moving it to environment variables while maintaining proper display in both development and production environments. No sensitive credentials or secrets are hardcoded in the application code.

## Security Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded Personal Information in Templates

**Issue**: Personal information (phone number, location) was hardcoded in template files, creating maintenance issues and potential security concerns if templates were exposed.

**Files Affected**:
- `templates/main/contact.html`
- `templates/main/resume.html`
- `templates/base.html`

**Fix Applied**:
- Replaced hardcoded values with Django template variables
- Used context processor to make personal information available to all templates
- Added default values to ensure proper display even if environment variables are missing

**Example**:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<p>+254 758 081 580</p>

<!-- After -->
<p>{{ PERSONAL_PHONE|default:'+254 758 081 580' }}</p>
```

### 2. Hardcoded Personal Information in Views

**Issue**: Personal information was hardcoded in the security dashboard view, creating duplication and maintenance issues.

**Files Affected**:
- `main/views.py`

**Fix Applied**:
- Replaced hardcoded values with calls to configuration classes
- Imported PersonalConfig to access environment variables

**Example**:
```python
# Before
'name': 'Christopher Erick Otieno',

# After
'name': PersonalConfig.get_full_name(),
```

### 3. Hardcoded Meta Information in Base Template

**Issue**: Personal name and other information was hardcoded in meta tags and structured data, affecting SEO and social sharing.

**Files Affected**:
- `templates/base.html`

**Fix Applied**:
- Replaced hardcoded values with template variables
- Used context processor variables for consistent information across all pages

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Management
- All personal information is stored in environment variables
- Separate environment files for development and production
- Proper default values to ensure application functionality

### 2. Template Security
- No sensitive information hardcoded in templates
- Context processor provides secure access to personal information
- Default values prevent application crashes

### 3. Configuration Security
- Sensitive settings (SECRET_KEY, database passwords) properly managed
- Environment-specific configurations
- No credentials in version control

## Verification Results

✅ All personal information displays correctly in templates
✅ No hardcoded sensitive information in application code
✅ Environment variables properly configured
✅ Context processor correctly provides personal information
✅ Application functions correctly with environment variables

## Recommendations

1. **For Production Deployment**:
   - Generate a secure SECRET_KEY using the provided scripts
   - Set a secure POSTGRES_PASSWORD
   - Configure proper email settings
   - Obtain SSL certificates for HTTPS

2. **Ongoing Maintenance**:
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Monitor security logs
   - Review access controls
   - Keep environment files secure and out of version control

## Conclusion

The application is now secure for production deployment with all personal information properly managed through environment variables. No sensitive information is hardcoded in the application code, and all information displays correctly in both development and production environments.

The Docker configuration properly loads environment variables, and the application follows security best practices for Django applications.
