# Cloudinary Integration Complete

## Summary

Your Cloudinary integration has been successfully completed! All project media files (images and writeups) have been updated to use Cloudinary URLs.

## What Was Done

1. **Environment Configuration**: Updated your [.env](file://c:\Users\CHRISTOPHER\Desktop\project\RESUME\.env) file with your actual Cloudinary credentials:
   - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dge5xurfz`
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=172734151545842`
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=Yry1SKCjiA8ddXCP8lqclK-B9u4`

2. **Media File Migration**: Updated all project media files to use Cloudinary URLs:
   - Featured images now point to: `https://res.cloudinary.com/dge5xurfz/image/upload/writeupsimages/FILENAME.EXT`
   - Writeup documents now point to: `https://res.cloudinary.com/dge5xurfz/image/upload/writeups/FILENAME.EXT`

3. **Verification**: Confirmed that all 3 projects have been updated with Cloudinary URLs.

## Results

All media files are now properly configured to load from Cloudinary:

- **Vulnerability Assessment Project**:
  - Image: `VULNERABILITY_ASSEMEMENT.PNG`
  - Writeup: `SECURITY_ASSESSEMENT.pdf`

- **SIEM Log Analysis Project**:
  - Image: `splunk.png`
  - Writeup: `Splunk_Exploring_SPL.pdf`

- **Malware Analysis Project**:
  - Image: `malware.PNG`
  - Writeup: `Malware_Analysis.pdf`

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Your Changes**: If you're using Render or another deployment platform, make sure to set the same Cloudinary environment variables there.

2. **Verify in Browser**: Visit your portfolio site to confirm that all images and writeups are displaying correctly.

3. **Check Cloudinary Dashboard**: Verify that your files are being accessed from Cloudinary.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Files Not Loading**: Check that the files actually exist in your Cloudinary account in the correct folders (`writeups` and `writeupsimages`).

2. **Wrong URLs**: Verify that the file names in Cloudinary exactly match what's in your database.

3. **Permission Issues**: Make sure your Cloudinary files have public access permissions.

## Security Notes

- Your Cloudinary API credentials are now properly configured in your environment variables
- The integration uses secure HTTPS URLs for all media files
- Cloudinary provides CDN delivery for better performance

Your portfolio site should now display all images and writeups correctly from Cloudinary!
